Ordered Lists
Ordered lists have numbers. You can nest ordered lists within a list item by indenting them. You can read more about formatting and syntax in the GitHub Help.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b
   
Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, use either the - or * character. As with ordered lists, you can nest a list by indenting two spaces.

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
